# gatsby-plugin-cdn-files

Download files from any string on a node so that they can be loaded with the static site.  This solution was put in place for static sites that are meant to be loaded by a CDN to avoid having a reliance on two separate data sources.

The source for this is based on the Gatsby Plugin Remote Images plugin.
